    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "Answer--Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a \n",
    "program to utilize multiple processes to achieve parallelism and perform tasks concurrently. \n",
    "Multithreading is useful for several reasons:\n",
    "1--Parallelism\n",
    "2--Avoiding GIL Limitattions\n",
    "3--Resource isolation\n",
    "4-Improved performance\n",
    "5--Fault isolation\n",
    "6--Scalability\n",
    "7--Use of external libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "Answer--Multiprocessing and multithreading are both techniques used to achieve concurrent execution\n",
    "in programs,\n",
    "but they have distinct differences in terms of how they utilize resources and manage concurrency.\n",
    "a--Process vs threads \n",
    "b--Resource utillization\n",
    "c--communication\n",
    "d--isolation and fault tolerance \n",
    "e--memory consumption\n",
    "f--Startup overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Write a python code to create a process using the multiprocessing module.\n",
    "Answer--import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker_function(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Worker {name} is executing.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    # Create a Process object\n",
    "    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker_function, args=(\"Process 1\",))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Start the process\n",
    "    process.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Wait for the process to finish\n",
    "    process.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Main process has finished.\")\n",
    "Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "Answer--A multiprocessing pool in Python is a convenient way to distribute the execution of \n",
    "multiple function calls across multiple processes. It provides a high-level interface for parallel\n",
    "execution,\n",
    "allowing you to perform tasks concurrently by spreading them across a pool of worker processes\n",
    "Advantages of using a multiprocessing pool:\n",
    "1.Efficient resource Utillizatation\n",
    "2.Simplified API\n",
    "3-Task distribution\n",
    "4.Automatic process management\n",
    "5-Optimized for input output tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How can we create a pool of worker processes in python using the multiprocessing module?\n",
    "Answer--Creating a pool of worker processes in Python using the multiprocessing module is \n",
    "straightforward. The Pool class from the multiprocessing module allows you to create \n",
    "a pool of worker processes and provides methods to distribute tasks among those processes.\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker_function(number):\n",
    "    return number * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a pool of worker processes\n",
    "    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=2) as pool:\n",
    "        # Distribute tasks using the map function\n",
    "        results = pool.map(worker_function, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Results:\", results)\n",
    "Q6. Write a python program to create 4 processes, each process should print a different\n",
    "number using the\n",
    "multiprocessing module in python.\n",
